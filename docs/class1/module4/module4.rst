Module â€“ Logon Protection
======================================================

Logon Protection protects credentials entered into IAPs Logon pages by encrypting data at the application layer on the client side. Transport Layer Security (TLS)/SSL protects traffic in transit, while application layer encryption protects credentials at the browser level, where TLS/SSL terminates. The extra layer of security can defend users from malware tampering and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks.
