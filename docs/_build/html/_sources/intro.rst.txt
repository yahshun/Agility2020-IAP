Getting Started
---------------

Please follow the instructions provided by the instructor to start your
lab and access your jump host.

To access your dedicated student lab environment, you will require a web browser and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client software. The web browser will be used to access the Lab Training Portal. The RDP client will be used to connect to the Jump Host, where you will be able to access the BIG-IP management interfaces (HTTPS, SSH).

1. Establish an RDP connection to your Jump Host and login with the following credentials:
User: user1
Password: user1

2. Access the BIG-IP GUI https://10.1.1.4 (you can double-click on the BIG-IP1 bookmark from Chrome).

3. Login into the BIG-IP Configuration Utility with the following credentials:
User: admin
Password: admin

.. NOTE::
	 All work for this lab will be performed exclusively from the Windows
	 jumphost. No installation or interaction with your local system is
	 required.
